# 🚖 Uber Reserve: Driving Adoption in Tier 1 Cities

## Context

**Feature:** Uber Reserve – lets riders pre-book rides in advance for time-critical needs (airport runs, meetings, commutes, concerts).  
**Current Challenge:** Despite being live, adoption among Tier 1 city professionals remains low.   
**Goal:** Diagnose barriers to adoption, define problem using First-Principles Thinking, uncover the true jobs-to-be-done (JTBD), and propose practical, innovative solutions.

### 1.🤔Defining the Problem Using First-Principles Thinking

#### Why do people really need Uber Reserve?

- **Timeliness & Reliability:** Reaching flights, meetings, or medical appointments on time.  
- **Anxiety Reduction:** Avoiding uncertainty around driver cancellations or surge pricing.  
- **Comfort over Public Transport:** Reducing stress from traffic, weather, or crowds.  
- **Routine Creation:** Seamless daily commutes without repeated booking friction.  
- **Control & Transparency:** Knowing price, driver, and ETA upfront.  
- **Day Planning:** Certainty in commute = better scheduling for the day.  
- **Long-Distance Viability:** Drivers often reject last-minute long trips; Reserve offers reliability.  
- **Cost Efficiency:** Locking fair, surge-free prices.  
- **Accessibility:** Making it easier for elderly or non-tech-savvy users to book.

| **Challenge**        | **Insight**                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Awareness Gap**     | Many users don’t know Reserve is useful beyond airports/events.             |
| **Trust Gap**         | Fear of driver cancellations or late arrivals reduces confidence.           |
| **Value Gap**         | Riders see little difference vs. booking 15–30 mins before.                 |
| **Workflow Mismatch** | People plan in their calendars, not directly in Uber.                       |
| **Price Friction**    | Perceived as premium; not positioned as “surge protection.”                 |
| **Flexibility Issues**| Rescheduling feels rigid and inconvenient.                                  |
| **Safety Needs**      | Lack of options like female drivers, recurring bookings.                    |
| **Ease of Use**       | Non-tech-savvy users (elderly, families) struggle to book.                  |

| **Income Consistency**| No recurring rides or subscription streams.                                 |
| **Recognition & Ratings** | No extra rewards for Reserve commitments.                              |
| **Safety & Preparation** | Female drivers need safety assurances; drivers need context for elderly/pregnant riders. |
